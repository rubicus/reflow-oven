Code for the reflow oven of Admittansen

This is code for a reflow oven for the electronics laboratory Admittansen in Link√∂ping.

This project assumes an Arudino Nano, two thermocouples connected to MAX6675 chips, and a 16x2 character LCD. The toaster oven is controlled by a solid state relay.

## TODO:
 * Implement PID control
 * More profiles (move profiles to a struct/class)
 * Refactor?
