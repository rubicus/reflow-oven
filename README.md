Code for the reflow oven of Admittansen

This is code for a reflow oven for the electronics laboratory Admittansen in Linköping. It's based on another project ("Hack a Toaster Oven for Reflow Soldering" by frank26080115 at instructables.com: http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-a-Toaster-Oven-for-Reflow-Soldering/?ALLSTEPS), but modified by Oskar Södergren to work with our oven (using other sensors, an Arduino and a simpler display without graphing among other things).

This project assumes an Arudino Nano, two thermocouples connected to MAX6675 chips, and a 16x2 character LCD. The toaster oven is controlled by a solid state relay.
